# Glossary

**CDN**: A _Content Delivery Network_ (CDN) is a network of servers around the internet that
share the task of delivering your files, so that your viewers get it faster on average.

**ElasticSearch**: ElasticSearch is an open source document database and
search engine.  In Participedia it is used to both store the authoritative
data (methods, cases, etc.) as well as to provide the full-text search
capability.

**SPA / Single Page App**: The term single page app is a relatively recent
term used to describe web sites where the browser gets the data for all (or most)
of the pages in an app in any request, and figures out what content to display
in the client (browser).  It can provide for faster interactions in between
pages because those often don't require much if any network traffic.
